    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a Developer and designer in the making. Having done a little bit of field engineering, and not liking it, I decided to try my luck in Software Engineering. Being in a position to bring someones idea to life has been my life's long goal and programming brings me a step closer. Also as someone who has worked in the aviation field for a little while and had extensive research I figured I could switch into a role I felt was more fitting for me. I still enjoy aeronautical just want to try it differently which led me here. I hope to gain programming skills that will enable me to analyse designs and run simulations.</p>

    <h2>Why Study At Moringa?</h2>
    <p>As a woman I have to work twice as hard as anybody else to be noticed. With Moringa I wil be noticed without having to work as hard as I otherwise would have been forced to by society. As the saying goes to be the best you need to hang out with the best. Or something like that.</p>
